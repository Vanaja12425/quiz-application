  <h1>DBMS Introduction</h1>  
  <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software solution designed to efficiently manage, organize, and retrieve data in a structured manner. It serves as a critical component in modern computing, enabling organizations to store, manipulate, and secure their data effectively. From small applications to enterprise systems, DBMS plays a vital role in supporting data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.</p>
  <h2>What is a DBMS?</h2>
  <p>A DBMS is a system that allows users to create, modify, and query databases while ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data access. Unlike traditional file systems, DBMS minimizes data redundancy, prevents inconsistencies, and simplifies data management with features like concurrent access and backup mechanisms. It organizes data into tables, views, schemas, and reports, providing a structured approach to data management.

    Example:
    A university database can store and manage student information, faculty records, and administrative data, allowing seamless retrieval, insertion, and deletion of information as required.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Data Modeling: Tools to create and modify data models, defining the structure and relationships within the database.</li>
    <li>Data Storage and Retrieval: Efficient mechanisms for storing data and executing queries to retrieve it quickly.</li>
    <li>Concurrency Control: Ensures multiple users can access the database simultaneously without conflicts.</li>
    <li>Data Integrity and Security: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and secure data, including access controls and encryption.</li>
    <li>Backup and Recovery: Protects data with regular backups and enables recovery in case of system failures.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Types of DBMS:</h2>
  <p>There are several types of Database Management Systems (DBMS), each tailored to different data structures, scalability requirements, and application needs. The most common types are as follows:</p>
  <h3>1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</h3>
  <p>RDBMS organizes data into tables (relations) composed of rows and columns. It uses primary keys to uniquely identify rows and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. Queries are written in SQL (Structured Query Language), which allows for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
    Examples: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and Postgre SQL.</p>
<h3>2.NoSQL DBMS</h3>
 <p>NoSQL systems are designed to handle large-scale data and provide high performance for scenarios where relational models might be restrictive. They store data in various non-relational formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns. These flexible data models enable rapid scaling and are well-suited for unstructured or semi-structured data.
    Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB and Redis.
</p>
<h3>3. Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)</h3>
<p>OODBMS integrates object-oriented programming concepts into the database environment, allowing data to be stored as objects. This approach supports complex data types and relationships, making it ideal for applications requiring advanced data modeling and real-world simulations.
    Examples: ObjectDB, db4o.
</p>
<h2>Database Languages</h2>
<p>Database languages are specialized sets of commands and instructions used to define, manipulate, and control data within a database. Each language type plays a distinct role in database management, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and security of data. The primary database languages include:</p>
<h3>1. Data Definition Language (DDL)</h3>
<p> DDL is the short name for Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.</p>
<ul>
    <li>CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
    <li>ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database</li>
    <li>DROP: delete objects from the database</li>
    <li>TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed</li>
    <li>COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary</li>
    <li>RENAME: rename an object</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h3>
    <p>DML focuses on manipulating the data stored in the database, enabling users to retrieve, add, update, and delete data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT: retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>INSERT: insert data into a table</li>
        <li>UPDATE: updates existing data within a table</li>
        <li>DELETE: Delete all records from a database table</li>
        <li>MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)</li>
        <li>CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram</li>
        <li>EXPLAIN PLAN: interpretation of the data access path</li>
        <li>LOCK TABLE: concurrency Control</li>
    </ul>
<h3>3. Data Control Language (DCL)</h3>
    <p>DCL commands manage access permissions, ensuring data security by controlling who can perform certain actions on the database.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>GRANT: Provides specific privileges to a user (e.g., SELECT, INSERT).</li>
    <li>REVOKE: Removes previously granted permissions from a user.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)</h3>
    <p>TCL commands oversee transactional data to maintain consistency, reliability, and atomicity.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ROLLBACK: Undoes changes made during a transaction.</li>
    <li>COMMIT: Saves all changes made during a transaction.</li>
    <li>SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which one can later roll back.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>5. Data Query Language (DQL)</h3>
    <p>DQL is a subset of DML, specifically focused on data retrieval.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>SELECT: The primary DQL command, used to query data from the database without altering its structure or contents.</li>
    </ul>
